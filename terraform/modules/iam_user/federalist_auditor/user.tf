# This user has access to all cloudtrail events in the account, as there
# doesn't seem to be a way of constraining to just cloudfront events relevant
# to a set of S3 buckets (or all S3 buckets, for that matter).
#
# If you need cloudtrail auditor access for another reason, PLEASE CREATE A NEW
# USER AND MODULE (yes, even with the same permissions).  Having separate users
# with the same permissions simplifies our work when we have to rotate
# credentials.
# No longer used - McGowan - 11/6/23 
# remove this and the whole module folder
